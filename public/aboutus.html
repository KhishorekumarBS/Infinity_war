            <p>I have been developing <strong>SugarCRM</strong> modules for about 1 year now.  SugarCRM is currently one of my favorite projects and I not only develop for it but I am now a loyal user to manage all sorts of projects and clients.  I highly recommend SugarCRM!</p>

            <p>I have been working with <strong>Magento eCommerce</strong> for about a year as well.  Magento is by far the hardest PHP Application I have ever had to learn and develop on.  It is also amazing and the BEST eCommerce platform for practically an eCommerce store of ANY size!  You can literally customize every single aspect of Magento through Class Overides and other fancy engineered code.  Magento is the most advanced, best open source eCommerce platform in my opinion.</p>

            <p>With about 6 years under my belt as a  <strong>WordPress</strong> developer, I know the ins and outs of what it is capable of doing and how to customize it to do just about anything needed.  WordPress is one of my FAVORITE platforms to work with!  After working all day on SugarCRM or Magento, WordPress is like a reward to work on it as it's much simpler and easier to work with and as I said....FUN!  <strong>I <3 WordPress</strong></p>
